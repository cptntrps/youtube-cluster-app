## 🔄 PERSISTENCE CARD (Re-read Every 20 Messages)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This section MUST be re-read every 20 messages to prevent framework drift**

### Current Session State

**ACTIVE MODE:** _____ (STANDARD | SPEED | REVIEW | DEBUG | LEARNING | EVALUATION | PROTOTYPE)

**AGPF STATUS:** _____ (Active | Inactive)

**CURRENT WORKFLOW:** _____ (Bug Fix | Feature Development | Refactoring | Code Review | Testing | Deployment | None)

**CURRENT TASK:** _____

**PROGRESS:** _____ todos completed

---

### The 5 Core Non-Negotiables (Always Active)

These rules MUST NEVER be violated, regardless of mode or circumstance:

1. **Never commit secrets** - No passwords, API keys, tokens in code
2. **All tests must pass before commit** - Zero failing tests allowed
3. **Always validate inputs** - Never trust user/external data
4. **Zero linting errors before commit** - Code must be clean
5. **Conventional commits required** - Format: `type(scope): description`

---

### Active Mode Behavior Reminder

**IF Standard Mode:**
- Balanced approach: thorough but efficient
- Ask for HIGH autonomy items, recommend for MEDIUM, always ask for LOW
- Show relevant context, not excessive detail

**IF Speed Mode:**
- MINIMAL communication (compact output)
- Maximum efficiency, no explanations unless asked
- Auto-execute HIGH+MEDIUM autonomy, still ask for LOW
- Heartbeats use compact format

**IF Review Mode:**
- ASK before ALL changes (even HIGH autonomy items)
- Show full context and reasoning
- Extra caution for critical systems
- Detailed status updates

**IF Debug Mode:**
- SHOW reasoning and decision process
- Explain what you're investigating and why
- Think out loud, make process visible
- Help user understand problem deeply

**IF Learning Mode:**
- EXPLAIN the "why" not just "what"
- Educational context for every action
- Teach concepts, don't just execute
- Use examples and analogies

**IF Evaluation Mode:**
- Detailed reporting with citations
- Show adherence to framework explicitly
- Reference specific guidelines
- Thorough documentation of decisions

**IF Prototype Mode:**
- RELAXED quality gates (50% coverage OK)
- Fast iteration over perfection
- Document technical debt
- Still enforce security non-negotiables

---

### AGPF Multi-Agent Reasoning Reminder

**IF AGPF Inactive:**
- Standard single-agent responses
- Can still reference expertise areas
- May activate AGPF if task requires multi-domain analysis

**IF AGPF Active:**
- MUST use [ORCHESTRATOR] for task coordination
- MUST use [SME: Domain] for specialist analysis
- MUST use explicit stances: [STANCE: Critique], [STANCE: Collaboration]
- MUST maintain multi-agent format throughout session
- Example domains: Security, Performance, Database, Frontend, Backend, QA

**CRITICAL:** If AGPF was activated, it stays active until explicitly deactivated. Don't revert to single-agent output.

---

### Workflow-Specific Reminders

**IF Bug Fix Workflow:**
1. Reproduce → 2. Write failing test → 3. Fix → 4. Verify all tests pass

**IF Feature Development:**
1. Understand → 2. Design → 3. Write tests (TDD) → 4. Implement → 5. Review

**IF Refactoring:**
1. Ensure tests exist → 2. Tests pass → 3. Refactor → 4. Tests still pass

**IF Code Review:**
1. Check security → 2. Check tests → 3. Check quality → 4. Check architecture

**IF Testing:**
1. Identify gaps → 2. Write tests (fail-first) → 3. Verify tests catch bugs

**IF Deployment:**
1. Run all checks → 2. Review changes → 3. Deploy → 4. Verify → 5. Monitor

### Framework Heartbeat Status

**MESSAGES SINCE START:** _____

**LAST HEARTBEAT:** Message #_____

**NEXT HEARTBEAT:** Message #_____

**COMPLIANCE STATUS:** _____ (PASS | ISSUES DETECTED)

---

**HOW TO USE THIS CARD:**

1. **At session start:** Fill in mode, workflow, task
2. **Every 20 messages:** Re-read this entire card
3. **After mode switch:** Update mode and re-read
4. **After workflow change:** Update workflow and re-read
5. **During heartbeat:** Verify compliance with non-negotiables

**PURPOSE:** This card fights attention decay. By re-reading every 20 messages, you maintain framework awareness even in 100+ message sessions.

## 🚨 Non-Negotiables (Never Break)

**Security:**
- ✋ Never commit secrets/passwords/API keys
- ✋ Always validate and sanitize inputs
- ✋ Always prevent SQL injection (parameterized queries)
- ✋ Always prevent XSS attacks

**Testing:**
- ✋ All tests must pass before commit
- ✋ Maintain ≥70% test coverage (80% for critical)
- ✋ Create tests for new features

**Quality:**
- ✋ Zero linting errors
- ✋ Pass type checking
- ✋ Build must complete

**Git:**
- ✋ Never commit to main/master
- ✋ Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- ✋ Atomic commits (one logical change)

---

## 📋 Workflow Decision Tree

```
What are you doing?

Bug reported/tests failing → workflows/bug-fix.md
New feature/enhancement → workflows/feature-development.md
Code needs improvement → workflows/refactoring.md
Reviewing code → workflows/code-review.md
Need test coverage → workflows/testing.md
Preparing for release → workflows/deployment.md
```

---

## 🎯 Autonomy Levels

**✅ HIGH (Act immediately):**
- Fix linting/formatting
- Remove console.logs
- Add missing tests
- Update docs
- Fix typos
- Add types

**🤔 MEDIUM (Recommend first):**
- Implement features
- Refactor code
- Performance optimizations
- Add validation
- Minor dependency updates

**🛑 LOW (Always ask):**
- Architecture changes
- Database schema
- New major dependencies
- Breaking API changes
- Security implementations
- Multi-module changes

---

## 📝 Commit Message Format

```bash
# Format
<type>(<scope>): <description>

# Types
feat:     New feature
fix:      Bug fix
docs:     Documentation only
refactor: Code change (no behavior change)
test:     Test changes
chore:    Maintenance (deps, config, etc.)
perf:     Performance improvement
style:    Formatting (no code change)

# Examples
feat(auth): add social login with Google
fix(api): handle null user in /profile endpoint
docs(readme): update installation instructions
refactor(utils): extract duplicate validation logic
test(auth): add integration tests for login flow
chore(deps): upgrade next to 14.0.0
```

## 🎛️ Meta Modes

| Mode | Use When | Behavior |
|------|----------|----------|
| **STANDARD** | Normal work | Balanced (default) |
| **SPEED** | Time-critical | Minimal output, max efficiency |
| **REVIEW** | Critical systems | Ask before all changes |
| **LEARNING** | Training | Explains WHY, not just WHAT |
| **DEBUG** | Troubleshooting | Shows reasoning |
| **EVALUATION** | Testing system | Detailed citations |
| **PROTOTYPE** | Exploration | Relaxed quality (50% coverage OK) |

```
# Activate
Activate SPEED MODE

# Combine with AGPF
ACTIVATE AGPF + REVIEW MODE
```

---

## 🤖 AGPF (Advanced)

**When to use:**
- Complex multi-domain tasks
- Architectural decisions
- Need multiple expert perspectives

**Agent Roles:**
- **SME** - Domain expert (Security, Performance, Database, etc.)
- **Orchestrator** - Task coordinator

**Activation:**
```
ACTIVATE AGPF

Build a secure file upload feature with performance optimization
```

**Result:** Multiple agents analyze from different perspectives, critique approaches, and collaborate on optimal solution.
