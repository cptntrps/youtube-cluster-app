# Bug Fix Workflow

Framework for investigating and resolving bugs.

---

## 🎯 Core Principle

**Understand before fixing.** Bugs are symptoms—find the root cause, don't just patch symptoms.

---

## 🚨 Non-Negotiables

Before marking a bug as fixed:

- ✋ **Create a test that reproduces the bug** (if feasible)
- ✋ **Verify the test fails before your fix** (proves you found the issue)
- ✋ **Verify the test passes after your fix** (proves fix works)
- ✋ **Run full test suite** (ensure no regressions)
- ✋ **No new linting errors**

---

## 🔄 Framework Heartbeat Integration

**This workflow integrates with the Framework Heartbeat Protocol to maintain quality throughout bug fixing.**

### Context Anchors (Auto-triggered)

These checkpoints trigger framework validation at critical workflow points:

**[CONTEXT ANCHOR: Bug Fix Start]**
- Re-read non-negotiables for bug-fix workflow
- Verify test-driven approach active
- Confirm: Will create test → verify it fails → fix → verify it passes

**[CONTEXT ANCHOR: Before Implementing Fix]**
- Validate test actually fails with current code
- This confirms we're testing the actual bug, not theater-testing
- If test doesn't fail: Investigate further or revise test

**[CONTEXT ANCHOR: After Implementing Fix]**
- Run full test suite (not just the new test)
- Verify no regressions introduced
- Check linting status

**[CONTEXT ANCHOR: Bug Fix Complete]**
- Framework heartbeat if 20+ messages since last
- All non-negotiables verified
- Ready for next task or workflow change

### Manual Framework Commands

During bug fixing, you can use:

- `SHOW SESSION STATUS` - Verify you're still in bug-fix workflow
- `REFRESH FRAMEWORK` - If debugging session was complex and long
- `FRAMEWORK DRIFT CHECK` - Before marking bug as fixed

**Purpose:** These context anchors ensure framework awareness remains high even during intense debugging sessions that can span 50+ messages.

## 📋 Framework

### 1. Understand the Bug

**Gather information:**
- Read the full bug report/issue
- Understand expected vs. actual behavior
- Note reproduction steps
- Check error messages, stack traces, logs
- Identify affected environment (dev, staging, production)

**Questions to answer:**
- What should happen?
- What actually happens?
- How do I reproduce it?
- Is this a regression (worked before)?
- How many users are affected?

**Tools:**
```
- Read issue/ticket
- Check relevant logs if available
- Review related test files
```

---

### 2. Locate the Issue

**Exploration strategies:**

**Strategy A - Error-Driven (if you have a stack trace):**
```
1. Find the file/line from stack trace
2. Read that file
3. Trace backwards to find root cause
```

**Strategy B - Feature-Driven (no stack trace):**
```
1. Identify which feature/module is affected
2. Use Task/Explore to find relevant files
3. Read key files (controllers, services, etc.)
4. Search for related functions with Grep
```

**Strategy C - Test-Driven:**
```
1. Find existing tests for the feature
2. Read test files to understand expected behavior
3. Read implementation files
4. Identify discrepancy
```

**Tools:**
```
- Grep for error messages or function names
- Task/Explore for unfamiliar code areas
- Read files in parallel once identified
```

---

### 3. Reproduce the Bug

**Create a failing test (when possible):**

```javascript
// Example - bug: user can login with unverified email

describe('Authentication', () => {
  it('should reject login for unverified email', async () => {
    const user = await createUser({ emailVerified: false });

    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/auth/login')
      .send({ email: user.email, password: 'password' });

    expect(response.status).toBe(403);
    expect(response.body.error).toMatch(/email not verified/i);
  });
});
```

**Verify test fails:**
```bash
npm test -- login.test.ts
```

**If can't write test:**
- Document reproduction steps
- Test manually if needed
- Note why automated test isn't feasible

---

### 4. Identify Root Cause

**Debug strategies:**

**Add logging (temporarily):**
```javascript
console.log('User object:', JSON.stringify(user, null, 2));
console.log('Email verified:', user.emailVerified);
```

**Trace execution flow:**
- Follow the code path from entry point
- Identify where behavior diverges from expected
- Check conditionals, loops, async operations

**Common bug patterns:**
- Null/undefined values
- Off-by-one errors
- Race conditions (async)
- Type coercion issues
- Missing validation
- Incorrect conditional logic
- Scope issues

**Questions to answer:**
- Why does the current code produce the wrong result?
- What assumption was incorrect?
- Is this a logic error, data error, or timing error?

---

### 5. Implement the Fix

**Principles:**
- Fix the root cause, not the symptom
- Minimal scope - change only what's necessary
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Consider edge cases

**Example:**
```javascript
// Before (bug)
async function login(email, password) {
  const user = await User.findByEmail(email);
  if (user && await user.verifyPassword(password)) {
    return generateToken(user);
  }
  throw new Error('Invalid credentials');
}

// After (fixed)
async function login(email, password) {
  const user = await User.findByEmail(email);

  if (!user || !await user.verifyPassword(password)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid credentials');
  }

  // FIX: Check email verification
  if (!user.emailVerified) {
    throw new Error('Email not verified');
  }

  return generateToken(user);
}
```

**Remove debug logging** added during investigation.

---

### 6. Verify the Fix

**Run the reproduction test:**
```bash
npm test -- login.test.ts
```

**Verify it now passes.**

**Run full test suite:**
```bash
npm test
```

**Verify no regressions.**

**Check for similar bugs:**
- Search codebase for similar patterns
- If found, fix them too (or create tickets)

**Example:**
```
Fixed login.ts - now search for other auth methods
that might have the same issue:
- signup.ts
- passwordReset.ts
- oauth.ts
```

---

### 7. Document and Commit

**Commit message format:**
```
fix(scope): brief description

Longer explanation of the bug and fix (optional).
Fixes #issue-number
```

**Example:**
```bash
git add src/auth/login.ts src/auth/login.test.ts

git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
fix(auth): require email verification before login

Previously, users with unverified emails could log in.
Now returns 403 error if email is not verified.

Fixes #456
EOF
)"
```

**Update issue/ticket:**
- Link to commit
- Explain what was wrong and how it's fixed
- Note if any follow-up work is needed

---

## 🎚️ Adaptive Approach

### Simple Bugs (typos, obvious errors)

**Streamlined process:**
```
1. Identify issue (obvious from error)
2. Fix it
3. Run tests
4. Commit

Skip: Reproduction test (obvious fix)
```

**Example:** Variable misspelled in one place.

---

### Complex Bugs (race conditions, data corruption)

**Thorough process:**
```
1. Deep investigation (logging, debugging)
2. Create comprehensive reproduction test
3. Possibly add multiple test cases
4. Implement fix
5. Extensive testing (unit, integration, manual)
6. Check for similar patterns
7. Document thoroughly
```

**Example:** Intermittent failure under load.

---

### Production Bugs (users affected NOW)

**Prioritize speed:**
```
1. Quick diagnosis
2. Implement minimal fix
3. Deploy hotfix
4. Create proper fix later if needed
5. Post-mortem analysis
```

**See:** [Rollback & Recovery](../advanced/rollback-recovery.md)

---

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

### Patching Symptoms

**❌ Bad:**
```javascript
// Crashes on undefined
// "Fix": Add defensive check
if (user && user.email) {
  sendEmail(user.email);
}
```

**✅ Good:**
```javascript
// Find why user is undefined in the first place
// Fix the root cause
```

---

### Incomplete Testing

**❌ Bad:**
```
Fixed the code, manually tested once, looks good.
```

**✅ Good:**
```
1. Added automated test
2. Verified test failed before fix
3. Verified test passes after fix
4. Ran full suite - no regressions
```

---

### Scope Creep

**❌ Bad:**
```
While fixing login bug, also refactored entire auth module,
renamed variables, reorganized files, updated styling...
```

**✅ Good:**
```
Fixed login bug only.
Created separate tickets for improvements noticed.
```

## ✅ Test Scenarios

Use these scenarios to verify you're following the bug-fix workflow correctly:

### Scenario 1: Simple Frontend Bug

**Given:** User reports "Submit button doesn't respond when form is empty"

**Expected workflow:**
1. ✓ Reproduce issue (click submit with empty form)
2. ✓ Locate code (find form submit handler)
3. ✓ Write failing test (test: "should show validation error when form empty")
4. ✓ Test fails (proves bug exists)
5. ✓ Implement fix (add validation check)
6. ✓ Test passes (proves fix works)
7. ✓ All tests pass (no regressions)
8. ✓ Commit message: `fix(form): add validation for empty form submission`

**Self-check:**
- [ ] Did I reproduce the bug before fixing?
- [ ] Did I create a test that failed before the fix?
- [ ] Does the test pass after the fix?
- [ ] Did I run the full test suite?
- [ ] Is the commit message in conventional format?

---

### Scenario 2: Backend API Bug

**Given:** API endpoint returns 500 error for specific user ID

**Expected workflow:**
1. ✓ Check error logs (find stack trace)
2. ✓ Reproduce (curl/Postman with problematic ID)
3. ✓ Locate code (find controller handling that endpoint)
4. ✓ Create test (`test: "should return user data for ID 12345"`)
5. ✓ Test fails with 500 error (reproduces bug)
6. ✓ Debug (null check missing for edge case)
7. ✓ Fix (add null check, return 404 for missing user)
8. ✓ Test passes
9. ✓ Add related test (`test: "should return 404 for non-existent user"`)
10. ✓ Commit: `fix(api): handle null user in getUserById endpoint`

**Self-check:**
- [ ] Did I check error logs first?
- [ ] Did I identify the root cause (not just symptom)?
- [ ] Did I add tests for both the bug and edge cases?
- [ ] Does error handling follow API conventions?

---

### Scenario 3: Data Corruption Bug

**Given:** "User balances sometimes show incorrect values"

**Expected workflow:**
1. ✓ Gather data (which users affected? when did it start?)
2. ✓ Reproduce with specific data (create test account, trigger bug)
3. ✓ Locate calculation logic (find balance calculation function)
4. ✓ Create test with known inputs/outputs
5. ✓ Test fails (balance calculation wrong)
6. ✓ Debug (missing transaction type filter)
7. ✓ Fix (filter by transaction type)
8. ✓ Test passes
9. ✓ Add data migration to fix existing bad data
10. ✓ Commit: `fix(accounts): filter transactions by type in balance calculation`

**Self-check:**
- [ ] Did I verify with actual data?
- [ ] Did I consider data migration for existing bad data?
- [ ] Did I add tests for all transaction types?
- [ ] Did I check for similar bugs in related code?

---

### Scenario 4: Performance Bug

**Given:** "Page loads slowly (>5 seconds) with large datasets"

**Expected workflow:**
1. ✓ Reproduce (load page with large dataset)
2. ✓ Profile (use browser DevTools or profiler)
3. ✓ Identify bottleneck (N+1 query problem)
4. ✓ Create performance test (measure query time)
5. ✓ Test shows slow performance (baseline)
6. ✓ Fix (use JOIN instead of multiple queries)
7. ✓ Test shows improved performance (5s → 0.3s)
8. ✓ Verify no behavior change (data still correct)
9. ✓ Commit: `perf(data): optimize user query with JOIN`

**Self-check:**
- [ ] Did I measure performance before and after?
- [ ] Did I verify behavior is unchanged?
- [ ] Did I check if fix applies to similar queries?
